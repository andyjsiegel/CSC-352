countPrimes output: 3
exCountPrimes output: 3
Result: SAME

Test Case 2: Larger range (1 20)
countPrimes output: 8
exCountPrimes output: 8
Result: SAME

Test Case 3: Invalid input - first > second (10 5)
countPrimes output: Lower bound must be less than upper bound
0
exCountPrimes output: 0
Result: DIFFERENT

Test Case 4: Negative numbers (-5 -1)
